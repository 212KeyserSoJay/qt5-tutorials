TwitterView displays Twitter messages from your friends, followers and 
the public.

Twitter provides a REST API [1]. Responses may be received in XML, JSON,
RSS or ATOM. This example receives responses from Twitter in XML and
translates the XML into HTML using XSL-T. 

The demonstration makes use of the new XSL-T 2.0 support in Qt 4.5.
Support for XSLT 2.0 is provided through the class QXmlQuery and 
is part of QtXmlPatterns module. The HTML is displayed using
Qt/WebKit.

The programs displays the background image, background color, text color,
link color as customized by the user on the Twitter website.

Portions of the HTML are dynamically created and inserted into the main
HTML. For example, the list of friends is queried and the XML response 
is translated into a HTML fragement which is inserted into the main HTML.
